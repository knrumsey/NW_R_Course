### Do this before you arrive

For best results, you should plan to **bring your laptop** with you to the course! Try to follow these steps (in order) before Tuesday.

1.  Install R
    1.  For [mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
    2.  For [windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
2.  Install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (free)
3.  Install the `tidyverse` R package
    1.  Open RStudio
    2.  Click in the **Console** (bottom left of the RStudio screen)
    3.  Type `install.packages("tidyverse")` and hit enter.
    4.  Type `print(require(tidyverse))`. If the word `TRUE` is printed then you're all done!

If you get stuck on any of these steps, send me an email at knrumsey (gmail) and I'll try to help you out on Monday evening. I'll also be at the meeting room 20 minutes before the seminar starts if you want in person help.
